# Ayman's dotfiles
This repository serves as a way to store my configuration files.

# About this repository
This contains my configuration files for my setup. You are free to copy any part of this for your own setup, but I don't recommend copying everything out of risk of things breaking. I personally use these configs on Arch Linux. Adjust accordingly to your system.
**⚠️ Warning:** Only recommended to use on Linux and UNIX systems. I am not responsible for any issues or damage caused by my configs. Be responsible.
